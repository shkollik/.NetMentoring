# .NetMentoring
Task 1 Data Structures
  
  LinkedList:
1. Implement linked list with such function set: Length, Add, AddAt, Remove, RemoveAt, ElementAt.
2. Write down test cases in a document (txt, docx) to cover your linked list functionality.
3. Write unit test for all your test cases.
4. Implement Ienumerable to make your list work with foeach

  HashTable:
  
1. Implement your hashtable, you should not use .Net structures (you can use only: array or linked list).
2. Here is interface you must implement:
  interface IHashTable
  {
  bool Contains(object key);
  void Add(object key, object value);
  object this[object key] { get; set; } bool TryGet(object key, out object value)
  }
3. If setter tries to set null, such element must be removed from the dictionary.
4. Any .Net object can be used as a key or value.
5. If you try to add the object by a key which already exists in the hash table â€“ throw an exception.

Task 2 IDisposable
1. Code fix. Please download code from 
https://github.com/epm-dmentor/2015-mentoring-program/tree/master/practice/tasks/IDisposable/IDisposableImplementation
and review it, if something is wrong correct it.
2. Fix code. Unmanaged code usage. FileWriter

Task 3 Garbage Collector
1. Please download code from https://github.com/epm-dmentor/2015-mentoring-program/tree/master/practice/tasks/IDisposable/ZooInDanger. 
Zoo application has an issue at some moment garbadge collection stops working properly. Please find out the reason, resolve it and explain.

									Commented the check in finalizer that leads to garbage collector issues

2. Write a class which will recover itself during garbage collection for the whole lifecycle of the application. During recovering you should write something to console to indicate that. 
Create this object and make GC to collection your object (mentee should exmplain how to do that: either by memory overloading by creating instances of some classes, or calling CG.Collect). 
Check if recovering works.
 (solution: usage of GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this) in object finalizer) Look at //Resurrection/Ressurection.
 
3. Write a class which will constancly recover itself, but you can not use any global fields for that. Please indicate recovering by writing some test to console. 
Close the programm, monitor what happened at the end.Why that happens.
(solution: before kill assign object to static variable) Look at //Resurrection/Ressurection2.

4. Find the issue, explain and fix: public struct Point { public int X; public void IncX() { X++; } } static void Main() { var points = new List<Point>(Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Select(p => new Point())); foreach (var p in points) { p.IncX(); } foreach (var p in points) { Console.WriteLine(p.X); } Console.ReadKey(); }
(solution: change foreach loop to for loop and use temp variable) Look at //Struct_Iteration
